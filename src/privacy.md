## 1. Introduction

Network Pro Strategies ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of clients and website visitors. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you interact with our website or services, consistent with applicable U.S. federal law and Arizona law, including Title 18, Chapter 5, Article 4 of the **[Arizona Revised Statutes](https://www.azleg.gov/arstitle/) (A.R.S. ¬ß¬ß 18-551, 18-552)**.

<a name="tracking"></a>

## 3. Web Analytics and Tracking

To better understand visitor behavior and optimize website functionality, we use **PostHog Cloud**, a hosted version of the open-source PostHog analytics platform. This tool helps us evaluate site performance and user engagement through the collection of non-personally identifiable technical data.

PostHog Cloud may collect and process information such as:

- Pages visited and navigation behavior
- Device type, browser version, and operating system
- Time spent on pages and interaction events (e.g., clicks, scrolls)
- Referral URLs and outbound link activity
- General geolocation (approximate, based on IP address)

We configure PostHog to prioritize user privacy. **Analytics tracking is automatically disabled when a user's browser sends a ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù (DNT) or [‚ÄúGlobal Privacy Control‚Äù (GPC / Sec-GPC)](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) signal**. No further action is required‚Äîyour browser settings are honored by default.

You can view your current tracking status on the [authoritative Privacy Policy page](https://netwk.pro/privacy) or via the [Privacy Dashboard](https://netwk.pro/privacy-dashboard). Additionally, you can set manual opt-out and opt-in settings stored as browser cookies. These settings override any Do Not Track (DNT) or Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals. **If you opt out, analytics tracking via PostHog is disabled entirely until you change your preference.** Your selection will persist until manually updated.

For convenient access, you can manage these settings through our [Privacy Dashboard](https://netwk.pro/privacy-dashboard).
