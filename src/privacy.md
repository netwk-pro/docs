## 1. Introduction

Network Pro Strategies ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") is committed to
protecting the privacy of clients and website visitors. This Privacy Policy
outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you interact
with our website or services, consistent with applicable U.S. federal law and
Arizona law, including Title 18, Chapter 5, Article 4 of the
**[Arizona Revised Statutes](https://www.azleg.gov/arstitle/) (A.R.S. ¬ß¬ß 18-551,
18-552)**.

<a name="collect"></a>

## 2. Information We Collect

We may collect the following categories of information:

- **Personal Identifiers** (e.g., name, email, phone number)
- **Business and Professional Information**
- **Device/Technical Information** (e.g., IP address, browser type, access logs)
- **Client-Submitted Content** related to our services

<a name="tracking"></a>

## 3. Web Analytics and Tracking

To better understand visitor behavior and optimize website functionality, we use
**PostHog Cloud**, a hosted version of the open-source PostHog analytics
platform. This tool helps us evaluate site performance and user engagement
through the collection of non-personally identifiable technical data.

PostHog Cloud may collect and process information such as:

- Pages visited and navigation behavior
- Device type, browser version, and operating system
- Time spent on pages and interaction events (e.g., clicks, scrolls)
- Referral URLs and outbound link activity
- General geolocation (approximate, based on IP address)

We configure PostHog to prioritize user privacy. **Analytics tracking is
automatically disabled when a user's browser sends a ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù (DNT) or
[‚ÄúGlobal Privacy Control‚Äù (GPC / Sec-GPC)](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/)
signal**. No further action is required‚Äîyour browser settings are honored by
default.

You can view your current tracking status on the
[authoritative Privacy Policy page](https://netwk.pro/privacy) or via the
[Privacy Dashboard](https://netwk.pro/privacy-dashboard). Additionally, you can
set manual opt-out and opt-in settings stored as browser cookies. These settings
override any Do Not Track (DNT) or Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals. **If
you opt out, analytics tracking via PostHog is disabled entirely until you
change your preference.** Your selection will persist until manually updated.

_For convenient access, you can manage these settings through our
[Privacy Dashboard](https://netwk.pro/privacy-dashboard)._

## 6. Legal Requests and Data Disclosure

We do not sell personal or business information. We disclose such data only when
required by law, and under limited, clearly defined circumstances:

- **Legal Compliance:** We may disclose information in response to a valid legal
  process‚Äîsuch as a subpoena, court order, or other binding legal request issued
  under applicable law. We do not voluntarily provide user data to government
  entities or third parties without a legal obligation to do so.
- **Review and Notice:** Each request for user data is reviewed to ensure it is
  lawful, specific, and properly served. Unless prohibited by law, we will
  notify affected users before disclosing any information.
- **Service Providers:** We may share personal or business information with
  trusted third-party vendors who support essential business functions (e.g.,
  payment processing, analytics, customer support). All such partnerships are
  governed by strict data protection terms and structured to uphold our core
  principles of _transparency and user privacy_.
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of
  assets, personal and business information may be transferred _only if the
  receiving party provides written assurances_ that: (a) the information will
  not be sold or misused, (b) it will be handled in a manner consistent with our
  privacy commitments, and (c) appropriate technical and contractual safeguards
  are in place to protect it.

Our policy is to require proper legal documentation and to scrutinize all
requests on a case-by-case basis. Outside these clearly defined situations, we
do not share, sell, or otherwise provide access to user information.

## 7. Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However,
no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely
secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. In compliance with **A.R.S. ¬ß
18-552**, we will notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach
involving personal information.
